        <h2>What Are Tides?</h2>
        <p>
            Tides are the periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun, combined with the Earth's rotation. Tides occur due to the difference in gravitational pull exerted by the Moon and Sun on different parts of the Earth.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What Causes Tides?</h2>
        <p>
            The primary cause of tides is the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on Earth's oceans. The Moon's gravity pulls water toward it, creating a "bulge" of water on the side of the Earth facing the Moon. On the opposite side, inertia causes another bulge. These bulges represent high tides. Areas between the bulges experience low tides.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Tides</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Tide:</strong> The time when the water level is at its highest point in a tidal cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Tide:</strong> The time when the water level is at its lowest point in a tidal cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Spring Tide:</strong> Occurs just after a new or full moon, when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in alignment. This alignment results in the highest high tides and the lowest low tides, creating a greater tidal range.</li>
            <li><strong>Neap Tide:</strong> Occurs just after the first or third quarters of the Moon when the Sun and Moon are at right angles relative to the Earth. This arrangement results in the smallest difference between high and low tides, creating a smaller tidal range.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequency of Tides</h2>
        <p>
            Most coastal areas experience two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes, known as a semidiurnal tide. Some regions experience diurnal tides (one high and one low tide per day) or mixed tides (two high and two low tides of varying heights each day).
        </p>

        <h2>Tidal Forces and Influencing Factors</h2>
        <p>
            The height and time of tides are influenced by several factors, including the shape of the coastline, the depth of the water, and the distance from the equator. The gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun, combined with the Earth's rotation, create complex tidal patterns that vary from place to place.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Tidal Phenomena</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tidal Bore:</strong> A tidal bore is a strong surge of water that travels up a river or narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay's current. It typically occurs in areas with a large tidal range and where the incoming tide is funneled into a narrow channel.</li>
            <li><strong>King Tide:</strong> A non-scientific term used to describe exceptionally high tides, often occurring during a new or full moon when the Moon is closest to Earth in its orbit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Role of the Sun in Tides</h2>
        <p>
            While the Moon has a greater effect on tides due to its proximity to Earth, the Sun also plays a significant role. The Sun's gravitational pull can enhance (during spring tides) or diminish (during neap tides) the Moon's effect on the tides. This interplay of gravitational forces is what causes the varying tidal ranges.
